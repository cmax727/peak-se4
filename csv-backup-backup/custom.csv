"CORE_VIEWS_SCRIPTS_ADMINADS_INDEX_DESCRIPTION";"Displaying advertisements is an excellent way to monetize your social network. By creating ad campaigns, you can determine exactly where your ads will appear, how long they will be displayed, and who they will be shown to. The key to generating substantial revenue from your social network is to create targeted ad campaigns. This means that you should make an effort to show specific ads to users based on their interests or personal characteristics (e.g. their profile information). To accomplish this, ad campaigns can be created for specific user levels and/or networks."

"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_SPAM_DESCRIPTION";"Social networks are often the target of aggressive spam tactics. This most often comes in the form of fake user accounts and spam in comments. On this page, you can manage various anti-spam and censorship features. Note: To turn on the signup image verification feature (a popular anti-spam tool), see the Signup Progress page."

"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_DESCRIPTION";"For very large social networks,
it may be necessary to enable caching to improve performance. If there is a noticable
decrease in performance on your social network, consider enabling caching below
(or upgrading your hardware). Caching takes some load off the database server by
storing commonly retrieved data in temporary files (file-based caching) or memcached
(memory-based caching). If you are not familiar with caching, we do not recommend
that you change any of these settings."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLE_DESCRIPTION";"Enable caching? Enabling
caching will decrease the CPU
usage of your database server (resulting in a decrease of page load
times). While some non-critical data may appear slightly out of date,
this will usually not be noticeable to users. For example, some of the
general site statistics on your homepage may take longer to update.
This will not be noticeable if your social network is already large and

For example, if you are running a business-oriented social network, you may want to change this word to ""connections""."
"USER_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_DIRECTION_DESCRIPTION";"Your social network can allow either one-way or two-way friendships. The default setting is two-way friendships as this is typical for most social networks. One-way friendships mean that when MemberA adds MemberB, MemberB will appear on MemberA's friend list but NOT the reverse."
"USER_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_VERIFICATION_DESCRIPTION";"Your social network can allow either verified or unverified friendship requests.
